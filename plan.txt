1. Test if our currentTimeMillis syntax works.... Achieve basic compilability

TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF currentTimeMillis:
2. How long does it take to:
  - print out basic String? ("Hello World")
  - create and populate an array of 10 ints and then print it
  - what if it was an array of 1000000 ints?
  - create and populate an array of 1000000 ints with random int values and print it
  - what if we increase the range of the random int values?
