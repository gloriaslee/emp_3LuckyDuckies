1. Test if our currentTimeMillis syntax works.... Achieve basic compilability

TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF currentTimeMillis:
2. How long does it take to:
  - what if it was an array of 1000000 ints?
  - create and populate an array of 1000000 ints with random int values and print it
  - what if we increase the range of the random int values?


3. Bin vs Lin (insert)
  - How long does it take to add using lin search vs bin search?

4. binSearch vs linSearch
How long does it take to:
Different data points to consider:
  - Print out binsearch of an arraylist of Integers for a target
  - Print out linsearch of an array of Integers for a target
  - How long does the array have to be before we get a significant time diff?
  - How long before an array is too long to be searched with linSearch, but still can be searched with binSearch?

5. Create a method to average data points

6. make larger test cases, 
      create binary search test cases, 
      and create a method to take average of data points.
  - created plans to create a .in file with a preset random super large array so that we don't have to waste time to generate a randomly large array.
    then, we will run test cases on this array.
