1. Test if our currentTimeMillis syntax works.... Achieve basic compilability

TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF currentTimeMillis:
2. How long does it take to:
  - print out basic String? ("Hello World")
  - create and populate an array of 10 ints and then print it
  - what if it was an array of 1000000 ints?
  - create and populate an array of 1000000 ints with random int values and print it
  - what if we increase the range of the random int values?

3. Printing out:
  - int arraylist vs String arraylist?
  - Which takes longer?

4. How long does it take to:
  - print out binsearch an arraylist of ints for a target
  - print out linsearch an array of ints for a target
  - how long does the array have to be before we get a significant time diff?
  - The same with an array of Strings?
  - How long before an array is too long to be searched with linSearch, but still can be searched with binSearch?
