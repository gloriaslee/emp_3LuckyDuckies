## Results:

All methods and results are referencing the same array (with same values and length of 20 million). 

Elapsed time for binary search for 200 random values in an array: 2
Elapsed time for linear search of 200 random values (that are not necessarily the same as binary search): 3591

Elapsed time for binary search for worst case: 2
Elapsed time for linear search for worst case: 16461

Testing the search function for 20 random individual targets
linear search results: [ 2569609, 13521675, 2805202, 6532043, 11643771, 16511294, 13373057, 3476115, 12853652, 5727585, 18585136, 17942015, 12611597, 15601898, 11123840, 15453113, 19451145, 3512756, 3805283, 17209048 ]
linear search times: [ 5, 22, 5, 11, 19, 27, 22, 5, 21, 10, 29, 28, 21, 25, 18, 25, 31, 6, 6, 28 ]

binary search results (should be the same as linear search results): [ 2569609, 13521675, 2805202, 6532043, 11643771, 16511294, 13373057, 3476115, 12853652, 5727585, 18585136, 17942015, 12611597, 15601898, 11123840, 15453113, 19451145, 3512756, 3805283, 17209048 ]
binary search times: [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

## Conclusions:

We found that binary search is significantly faster than linear search in finding the target relative to the same array.
