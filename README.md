#### 3LuckyDuckies: Gloria Lee, Ziying Jian, Nora Miller

## Results:
### Testing elapsed time for searching randomly generated values:

####All methods and results are referencing the same 20 million item-long array

|           | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | --- |
| Elapsed time for binary search for 200 random values in an array | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search of 200 newly generated random values | 3591 | 3551 | 3484 |
| Elapsed time for binary search for worst case | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search for worst case | 16461 | 17032 | 17249 |

####For a different array of length 5 million:

|           | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | --- |
| Elapsed time for binary search for 200 random values in an array | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search of 200 newly generated random values | 3591 | 3551 | 3484 |
| Elapsed time for binary search for worst case | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search for worst case | 16461 | 17032 | 17249 |



## Conclusions:

We found that binary search is significantly faster than linear search in finding the target relative to the same array. Moreover, the difference in time between binary searches and linear searches appear to be larger for
