#### 3LuckyDuckies: Gloria Lee, Ziying Jian, Nora Miller

## Results:
### Testing elapsed time for searching randomly generated values:

####All methods and results are referencing the same 20 million item-long array

|           | Trial 1 |
| --------- | ----- |
| Elapsed time for binary search for 200 random values in an array | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search of 200 newly generated random values | 3591 |
| Elapsed time for binary search for worst case | 2 |
| Elapsed time for linear search for worst case | 16461 |



For a different array of length 5 million:





## Conclusions:

We found that binary search is significantly faster than linear search in finding the target relative to the same array. Moreover, the difference in time between
