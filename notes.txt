QCC:
- What does it take to move from 0 milliseconds to 1 milliseconds of run time
for each object type, such as Strings or Integers

DISCO:
- When populating array list of 1000000 ints with random values and printing it out,
  the machine takes too long and we must ^C out.
- Arrays need to be LARGE >999 in order to discern any meaningful differences
    - created test case that caused significant time difference
    - the bigger the array, the longer the time
    - takes even more time if we're inputting random values into arrays
