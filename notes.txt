QCC:
- What does it take to move from 0 milliseconds to 1 milliseconds of run time

- Why is there such great variability in how long the same function might take, depending on when you run it?

- How big is big enough? Or too big?

- How long does the array have to be before BinSearch takes >= 1 millisecond to search for a target?

-

DISCO:
- When populating array list of 1000000 ints with random values and printing it out,
  the machine takes too long and we must ^C out.
- Arrays need to be LARGE >999 in order to discern any meaningful differences
    - created test case that caused significant time difference
    - the bigger the array, the longer the time
    - takes even more time if we're inputting random values into arrays
- However, they can't be TOO large - 60 million is around the cap for Nora's computer; up to 200 million for Gloria's
