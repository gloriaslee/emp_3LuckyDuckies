QCC:
- What does it take to move from 0 milliseconds to 1 milliseconds of run time?

DISCO:
- When populating array list of 1000000 ints with random values and printing it out,
  computer takes too long and we must ^C out.

  - noticed that time dif when print out hello is 0
    - try to create test case that causes significant time difference
    - the bigger the array, the longer the time
    - takes even more time if we're inputting random values into arrays
