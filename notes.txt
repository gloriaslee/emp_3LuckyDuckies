NOTES TO MYKOLYK: 
- We chose to use versions so we could refer back to older versions as needed (and, as it turns out, we did just that!) 
  The most recent work should be in v5.
- We kept our average-like testing function even after adding a worst case scenario testing function, because we think it's 
  still useful. 


QCC:
- Why is there such great variability in how long the same function might take, depending on when you run it?

- How big is big enough? Or too big?

- How long does the array have to be before BinSearch takes >= 1 millisecond to search for a target?

-

DISCO:
- When populating array list of 1000000 ints with random values and printing it out,
  the machine takes too long and we must ^C out.
- Arrays need to be LARGE >999 in order to discern any meaningful differences
    - created test case that caused significant time difference
    - the bigger the array, the longer the time
    - takes even more time if we're inputting random values into arrays
- However, they can't be TOO large - 60 million is around the cap for Nora's computer; up to 200 million for Gloria's
- With the final version of our code, binSearch search times still are only 0 milliseconds for searching just one element,
no matter how large we make the array until the array is too large overall.
- It's a better idea to get the elapsed time from the start to end of the for loop instead of getting the elapsed time
to find each individual target.
- Yes, it IS possible to run a bunch of stuff using comparables without getting very many weird error messages
requiring you to run it with a special tag. However, in order to avoid errors, you need to compile it, compile it again with the tag 
if prompted, then compile it a third time without the tag. (We don't know why, though) 

GALLERY TOUR: 
- We seem not to be the only group rather attached to our average-of-random-values search comparison method. 
- Team Mumblecore had an interesting and useful table, listing runtimes for the worst cases of linear and binary search 
based on the length of the array. This seems to address the hypothesis more directly than the way we were previously presenting our data
- Hearing the ways that other teas described their experiments, in general, we need to be careful around our use of words like 'trial'
and 'test case', because using them ambiguously leads to confusion.
