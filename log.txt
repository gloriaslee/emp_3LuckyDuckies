2021-12-16, whole team, v0:
  - Learned syntax for using currentTimeMillis
  - Fixed up binSearch code using code in library
  - Jotted down observations in notes.txt
  - Created test cases to cause significant time differences from each other.
  - Added method to add values into an arraylist and maintain the sorted invariant
2021-12-16, Nora, v1, v2: 
  - Attempted to invoke LinSearch in SearchDriver; ran into issues with using linSearch, which requires Comparables, on the ArrayLists in SearchDriver
  - Modified LinSearch and BinSearch to use ArrayList<Integers> instead of Comparables. 
  - Checked again to make sure the search functions were working as expected
  - Is currently getting a strange error in which linear searching an array appears to take either 0 or 15 to 16 seconds the majority of the time
